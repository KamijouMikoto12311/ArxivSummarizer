# ArxivSummarizer

ArxivSummarizer is a Python-based tool designed to process PDF files by extracting text and generating summaries using deep learning models. The project aims to simplify the summarization of academic papers and technical documents, enabling quick insights and streamlined research workflows.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ArxivSummarizer.git
   ```

2. Change directory into the project folder:

   ```bash

   ```

## Usage

To run the summarization process, simply execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure to copy your API key to `config/api.txt` and copy the url of advanced searching from arxiv to `config/url.json`. You can modify the url according to your preferences.

## Customization

- **Summarization Model:** The project uses `Pro/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3` by default. You can change the model in the `_process_single_pdf` function inside SiliconFlow.py.
- **PDF Extraction:** Modify the extraction logic in pdftext.py to better suit your document formatting requirements.
